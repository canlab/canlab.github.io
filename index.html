  <h1>Canlab Code Repositories</h1>

  These are the documentation pages for the canlab code repositories.

  <h2> CanlabCore </h2>
  <p><b> CanlabCore </b> contains all of our first and second level analysis code. Essentially
    anything other than preprocessing, applying our private masks, or individual research projects
    is contained in this repository. Built on SPM8 mostly, it should still work with SPM12, but</p>

    <h2> preprocess </h2>
  <p> This is our legacy preprocessing pipeline. It uses our modified version of SPM8 mostly,
    (see below) but some parts are SPM12 compatible. We're working on an all-new
    preprocessing pipeline based on nipype and FMRIPREP right now, so you should probably not
    use this for anything.
