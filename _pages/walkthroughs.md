This series of walkthroughs is designed to illustrate the CANlab interactive analysis tools, and some analysis principles as well.
Code to run each walkthrough is included in the CANlab core toolbox or on Neurovault. See the main [CANlab intro page](/) for more on the philosophy behind the interactive analysis approach.

## Getting started

[1. installing tools](canlab_help_1_installing_tools.html)

[2. load a sample dataset](canlab_help_2_load_a_sample_dataset/canlab_help_2_load_a_sample_dataset.html)

## Basic analyses

[3. group t-test](canlab_help_3_voxelwise_t_test_walkthrough/canlab_help_3_voxelwise_t_test_walkthrough.html)

[4. threshold statistic images and write to files ](canlab_help_4_write_data_to_image_file_format/canlab_help_4_write_data_to_image_file_format.html)

[5. regression, interactive analysis](canlab_help_5_regression_walkthrough/canlab_help_5_regression_walkthrough.html)
