[Setup walkthrough](/canlab_help_1_installing_tools.html)

This page walks through Matlab and Github setup and then provides an introduction to CAN Lab object-oriented tools.

Install Matlab
======
You can [install Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/) from the Mathworks website.

Set up CAN Lab tools from Github
======
There are two options for this step: 1) Download a .zip file with the code, or 2) Install Github on your computer and Clone
the repository.  With the 2nd option you will get updates, but it requires more steps and some knowledge of how Github works.

First, go to the [Github CANlab tools site](https://github.com/canlab/CanlabCore):

Using the green "Clone or Download" drop down you can either download a zip file of the repository or clone using git with
a web URL for the repository (these are options 1 and 2 above, respectively).

Repositories
======
The tools consist of a set of linked repositories.
