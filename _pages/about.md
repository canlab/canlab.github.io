Below are examples consisting of code, results, and figures for each section. These examples require the [CAN Lab Core Tools Repository](https://github.com/canlab/CanlabCore).
Running the examples in your own environment also serves as a preliminary unit test frame for the CAN Lab tools.

Please document errors by posting issues on the [CAN Lab Github page](https://github.com/canlab/CanlabScripts/issues).

For information on software requirements and getting set up to run second-level scripts see our [Setup and System Requirements](/setup.md) page.

For a tutorial on how to use CAN LAb scripts to create a second-level analysis pipeline dealing with groups of subjects, please see our [Second-Level 
Analysis Tutorial](/second_level.md)
