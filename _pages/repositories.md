Repositories
======
The CANlab imaging analysis tools consist of a set of linked Github repositories. Several of these are needed for interactive data analysis using our [object-oriented framework](/objectoriented/), including [CanlabCore](https://github.com/canlab/CanlabCore), [CANlab_help_examples](https://github.com/canlab/CANlab_help_examples), and [Neuroimaging_Pattern_Masks](https://github.com/canlab/Neuroimaging_Pattern_Masks).
Other toolboxes are semi-stand-alone but require [CanlabCore](https://github.com/canlab/CanlabCore).

CANlab Core Tools                             https://github.com/canlab/CanlabCore
